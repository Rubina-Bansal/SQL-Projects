-- 1. Question 1: - We need to find out the total visits to all restaurants under all alcohol categories available.
SELECT a.placeID,a.name, a.alcohol, COUNT(distinct b.userid)
FROM geoplaces2 a JOIN rating_final b 
ON a.placeID = b.placeID
where a.alcohol not like "%NO_Alcohol%"
GROUP BY alcohol, a.placeID, a.name;                 

/* Inference:
From the data it can be seen that majority of the restaurants serve the wine-beer type of alcohol. Most of the visits were made to Cafeteria y 
Restaurant El Pacifico which serves the alcohol under wine-beer category. Further, in the full_bar category, La Cantina Restaurant has the maximum 
number of visits. The restaurants that are least visited are 'Mikasa' and 'Rincon del Bife' under wine-beer and full bar categories respectively.
This analysis helps in analyzing the popularity of places that serve alcohol and identifying the number of users who have rated those places. 
*/






-- Question 2: -find out the average rating according to alcohol and price so that we can understand the rating in 
-- respective price categories as well.
 
SELECT distinct b.placeID,b.name, b.alcohol, b.price, AVG(a.rating) OVER(PARTITION BY b.alcohol) AS avg_rating_asPer_alcohol,
AVG(a.rating) OVER(PARTITION BY b.price) AS avg_rating_asPer_price
FROM rating_final a JOIN geoplaces2 b
ON a.placeID = b.placeID 
WHERE b.alcohol NOT LIKE "%NO_Alcohol%"                                
ORDER BY avg_rating_asPer_alcohol DESC, avg_rating_asPer_price desc;


/* Inference:
The highest rating with respect to price, as well as the alcohol is given to the restaurants under the category of full-bar type. There are 4 
restaurants which top the rating list with respect to both price and alcohol, which include la Cantina, Rincon del Bife, Restaurant and Bar and 
Clothesline Carlos N Charlies and La Cantina Restaurante even though the price is high.
Considering both the price ratings and alcohol ratings, lowest ratings are given to particularly 5 restaurants which belong under the wine-beer 
category of alcohol. The restaurants are Unicols Pizza, emilianos, El cotorreo , Abondance Restaurante Bar and crudalia. These restaurants have low 
ratings despite having low prices.
*/





-- Question 3:Let’s write a query to quantify that what are the parking availability as well in different alcohol 
-- categories along with the total number of restaurants.

SELECT a.alcohol AS alcohol_type, b.parking_lot,
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.placeID) AS total_restaurants, 
       SUM(b.parking_lot IN ('public', 'yes', 'valet parking', 'fee', 'street','validated parking')) AS ParkingAvailable_count, 
       SUM(b.parking_lot = 'none') AS NoParking_count
FROM geoplaces2 a LEFT JOIN chefmozparking b
ON a.placeID = b.placeID
 WHERE a.alcohol NOT LIKE '%NO_Alcohol%'
GROUP BY a.alcohol, b.parking_lot;

/* Inference:
From the data it can be inferred that there are a total of three Full-bar restaurants with no parking availability. In case of wine-beer 
restaurants there are 12 restaurants which do not have parking facilities.
*/





-- Question 4: -Also take out the percentage of different cuisine in each alcohol type.
SELECT 
  a.alcohol AS alcohol_type, 
  b.rcuisine AS cuisine_type, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT a.placeid) AS total_restaurants,
  SUM(p.parking_lot
  IN ('public', 'yes', 'valet parking', 'fee', 'street','validated parking')) AS parking_available_count,
  SUM(p.parking_lot = 'none') AS no_parking_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT a.placeid) / SUM(COUNT(DISTINCT a.placeid)) OVER (PARTITION BY a.alcohol) * 100, 2) AS cuisine_percentage
FROM geoplaces2 a 
JOIN chefmozCuisine b ON a.placeid = b.placeid 
JOIN chefmozparking p ON a.placeid = p.placeid
WHERE a.alcohol NOT LIKE '%NO_Alcohol%' AND a.country <> '?'
GROUP BY a.alcohol, b.rcuisine
ORDER BY a.alcohol, cuisine_percentage DESC;


/* Inference:
From the data, It can be seen maximum varieties of cuisines are present in wine-beer type of restaurants. Majority of full bar and wine beer 
restaurants have bar cuisine. The cuisines with least percentage include bar pub brewery, Italian, Japanese and Mexican.
It can also be seen that all the restaurants with Mexican cuisine type have the parking availability. All the international and contemporary 
restaurants also have parking availability.
There is only one restaurant with Japanese cuisine. Even the Italian cuisine is served in only one restaurant.
*/




-- Questions 5: - let’s take out the average rating of each state.
update geoplaces2 set state= replace(state,"san luis potos","San Luis Potosi");
update geoplaces2 set state= replace(state,"San Luis Potosii","San Luis Potosi");

SELECT 
    a.state, ROUND(AVG(b.rating), 2) AS average_rating
FROM 
    geoplaces2 a
        INNER JOIN
    rating_final b ON a.placeid = b.placeid where a.state <> "?" 
GROUP BY state order by average_rating desc;

/* 
Inference:
The column state in geoplaces2 table required data cleaning as the strings “san luis potos” and "San Luis Potosii" were believed to be same as the string “San Luis Potosi”. Hence, they were corrected.
Further it is seen that the highest rating is given to the state s.l.p which is presumed to be San Luis Potosi but due to uncertainty it is left unchanged since this has to be discussed and cross checked.
However, the state with the least rating is Tamaulipas.  */
 
 
 
 
 -- Questions 6: -' Tamaulipas' Is the lowest average rated state. Quantify the reason why it is the lowest rated by providing the
--  summary on the basis of State, alcohol, and Cuisine.
SELECT 
    COUNT(gp.placeid) AS number_of_restaurants,

/*Inference
there are only 6 type of cuisines there in tamaulipas and non of them serve alcohol
 where as the highest rated place ie san luis potos have restaurants with 11 different quisines along with 6 restaurants 
 serving alcohol.*/
