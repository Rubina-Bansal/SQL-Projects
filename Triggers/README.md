# Triggers

Triggers are defined using SQL syntax and are associated with a specific table or view. The syntax for defining a trigger includes the event that 
triggers the trigger, the table or view that the trigger is associated with, and the code that is executed when the trigger is triggered.
Triggers can be a powerful tool in SQL, but they should be used with caution as they can have a significant impact on performance and can be difficult 
to debug if not implemented correctly.
